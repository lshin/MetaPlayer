@TODO:

Documentation:
- Document plugin interfaces
- Styling guide
- Configuration object guide
- Complete Documentation package

Features:
- Inherit with configuration of the parent element to eliminate mucking with
  CSS for proper sizing
- Need a sorting function for the source array so that playlist types (smil,
  m3u8, ism/manifest, etc...) are considered first. (mp4 for idevice)
- Return to the proper scroll position when un-fullscreening a video
- Need a controlled way to get back to the playlist when started with a rendered feed
- Firefox has a core issue with plugin positioning causing the plugin to reload.
  As a result, fullscreen in firefox simply maximizes the video and scrolls there.
  This isn't a todo, just a note of the behavior.

- Update plugin model to allow insertion of different video objects
- Add the different controls and video objects directly to the OVP object so that
  someone can override them or their prototype? Otherwise, maybe a factory function
  and store the objects in the ovpconfig defaults.
- Document sprite configuration and allow passing sprites to flash/sl
  to promote the use of fullscreen (and therefore hardware acceleration)
